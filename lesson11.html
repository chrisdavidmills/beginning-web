  <p>In this article we will explore some supplementary techniques that aren't exactly essential for web development, but are very useful for web users in general.</p>

  <h2>Searching for images on the Web</h2>

  <p>At the bottom of lesson 1 — the <a href="lesson1#hacking">Hacking the school website</a> section — we discussed how to find an image using <a href="https://www.google.com/imghp">Google image search</a>. In this section we will expand this topic further.</p>

  <h3>Copyright</h3>

  <p>One thing you need to bear in mind on the Web when you start to use other people's images (or other types of files) in your own work is copyright. When people publish work, they publish it under a license that specifies what rights other people have to use it.</p>

  <p>If the license is "All rights reserved", it means that legally you can't use their work unless you make a deal with them, which usually involves paying them some money.</p>

  <p>However, there are many licensing systems that do permit reuse of work, which some conditions, such as:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>You need to publish your work under the same license as the work you reused.</li>
    <li>You can't reuse the work for a commercial project (i.e. one that will be sold.)</li>
    <li>You need to credit the author of the work you reused.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The conditions differ from license to license. For a good guide to the most common license types, read <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/03/24/a-short-guide-to-open-source-and-similar-licenses/">A Short Guide To Open-Source And Similar Licenses</a>, by Cameron Chapman.</p>

  <h3>Finding open source licensed images using flickr</h3>

  <p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a> is an image sharing service, so great for finding images. To search for open source licensed images, do this:</p>
  
   <ol>
     <li>Go to Flickr's <a href="https://www.flickr.com/search/advanced/">Advanced search</a> page.</li>
     <li>Type what you want to search for in the search box at the top.</li>
     <li>Check the <em>Only search within Creative Commons-licensed content</em> and <em>Find content to modify, adapt, or build upon</em> boxes.</li>
     <li>Click <em>Search</em>.</li>
   </ol>

   <h2>Clever tricks with Google search</h2>

   <p>Google are still best known for being a <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/">search engine</a>, but you might be interested to know that there are a number of clever tricks built into the search bar. Let's investigate a few now.</p>

   <h3>Basics: Complete strings, wildcards, or excluding words/sites.</h3>

   <ul>
     <li>By default, Google will search for the string of text you give it, but not in the exact order, or all together. To make sure it searches for a complete string of text in that exact order, put quotes round it — example: <strong>"my dog has no nose"</strong>.</li>
     <li>If you want to search for a phrase but are unsure of one or more words, you can include a * character as a wildcard in place of the unknown words, and Google will give you suggestions — example: <strong>how to * a phone</strong>.</li>
     <li>If you want to search for something, but exclude a word, you can put a minus before that word (no space). Example: <strong>optimus prime -galvatron</strong>.</li>
     <li>You can also do the same things with whole websites — example: <strong>game reviews -site:gamespot.com</strong> or <strong>film news site:bbc.co.uk</strong>  
   </ul>

   <h3>Searching inside web addresses or site titles</h3>

   <ul>
     <li>If you want to search for something just inside the web page title, you can put -intitle: before it — example: <strong>-intitle: dinosaur</strong> (note the space after the :)</li>
     <li>If you want to search for something just inside the web address (URL), you can use -inurl: instead — example: <strong>-inurl: topgear</strong> (note the space after the :)</li>
   </ul>

   <h3>Finding specific filetypes and locations</h3>

   <ul>
     <li>You can search for specific filetypes using filetype: — example <strong>XBox One filetype: pdf</strong> (note the space after the :).</li>
     <li>You can also find sites associated with specific locations, using location: — example <strong>hotels location: auckland</strong></li>
   </ul>

   <h3>Number ranges and maths</h3>

   <ul>
     <li>You can search between a range of numbers using two dots between them. examples: <strong>wars 1900..1950, camera £200..£400</strong></li>
     <li>You can also do maths in the Google search bar. Try these:
       <ul>
         <li>9+30</li>
         <li>20-4</li>
         <li>30*30 or 30x30</li>
         <li>40/10</li>
         <li>4^2</li>
       </ul>
     </li>
   </ul>

   <h3>Reverse image search</h3>

   <p>If you have an image but you don't know what it is and want to find out:</p>

   <ul>
     <li>Go to <a href="https://www.google.com/imghp?gws_rd=ssl">Google image search</a>.</li>
     <li>Click the little camera icon in the search bar.</li>
     <li>Now you've got two options - you can either paste in the web address of an image, or upload an image you have on your local hard drive. Here are some examples to try it out on if you've not got any of your own: <a href="images/11a.jpg">Example 1</a>, <a href="images/11b.jpg">Example 2</a>.</li>
   </ul>

   <h3>Advanced: adding parameters to the search query string</h3>
  
  <p>When you do a search in Google, you'll notice a load of stuff put on the end of the search result web address. These are called parameters, and they give Google extra information on how to search for things. You can hack these on the end yourself. Here are a couple of examples.</p>

   <ul>
     <li>To search images just for faces, put &tbs=itp:face  on the end — example <strong>Search for <em>Rose</em> in google image search, then put &tbs=itp:face on the end of the web address and press enter.</strong></li>
     <li>To search for recently updated pages, you can put for example &tbs=qdr:h5 to search for results updated in the last 5 hours, or you can replace the h with m or s for 5 months or seconds. You can also replace the number with anything you like. Example — <strong>search for <em>politics site:bbc.co.uk</em> in normal Google, then put &tbs=qdr:h1 on to the end of the web address and press enter.</strong>.</li>
   </ul>

   <h3>Google Easter eggs</h3>

   <p>To show they are not completely without a sense of humour, Google have also included several easter eggs. Try searching for these:</p>

   <ul>
     <li>do a barrel roll</li>
     <li>askew</li>
     <li>google in 1998</li>
     <li><em>atari breakout</em> (in google image search)</li>
     <li><em>set timer for</em>, followed by an amount of time, e.g. 10 seconds.</li>
     <li><em>bacon number</em> followed by a film star's name.</li>
     <li>answer to life, the universe and everything</li>
     <li>Are you a pirate? Search with <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?hl=xx-pirate">Google Pirate instead</a>.</li>
     <li>My favourite: search for <em>police telephone box</em>, click on the first search result and select street view.</li>
    </ul>
