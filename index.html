  <h2>A ten week course to teach the basics of web design</h2>

<main>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The Web is a good place to begin learning about how technology works, and fundamental Information and Communication Technology (ICT) concepts such as programming. It is everywhere and familiar, easy to learn compared to other programming platforms, and there is a lot of help available due to the Web's largely free and open nature. This course will aim to teach children some background information on how the web works and why the web is so interesting, the basic fundamentals of HTML (the language used to structure data on the Web) and CSS basics (the language used to style and layout the Web), possibly then moving on to some more advanced CSS and JavaScript (the web's main programming/logic language) if there is time.</p>

<p class="note">This course has mainly been written with 10-11 year old children in mind, but anyone who is a complete beginner to web design should be able to get a lot out of it.</p>

<p class="note">Note: if you have any feedback or change requests you want to give about the course, send pull requests/comments to the <a href="https://github.com/chrisdavidmills/beginning-web">Introduction to Coding Github repo</a>, or <a href="https://twitter.com/chrisdavidmills">send Chris a message on Twitter</a>.</p>

<h2>What do you need?</h2>

<p>To take this course, you need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>These notes, either in printed or online form. Online is better, as there are a lot of linked resources in here that won't work very well on paper</li>
  <li>A computer with Internet access</li>
  <li>At least one decent web browser installed: Any of the following are ok:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new">Firefox</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/">Chrome</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://support.apple.com/downloads/#safari">Safari</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://www.opera.com/download">Opera</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/download-ie">Internet Explorer (10 or above)</a>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A <a href="https://webmaker.org/en-GB">Mozilla Webmaker</a> login (you basically just need an e-mail address.) If you can't or don't want to get this, <a href="http://www.jsbin.com">JSBin</a> is a good alternative.</li>
</ul>
