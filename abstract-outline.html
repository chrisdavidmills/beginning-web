  <h1>Outline for St. Chad's web basics course</h1>
  <h2>Chris Mills, October 2013</h2>
</hgroup>

<main>
<p>The following document provides scope and basic structure for a ten hour (one hour per week) course to be taught to 10-11 year olds at St Chad's school. This is a pilot course, aimed at gauging interest in technology/programming/web development in primary school children and hopefully leading to more structured learning and curricula of this type in the Saddleworth area.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Title: It's my Web! (Understanding how the web works, and how to change it)</strong></p>

<h2>Scope</h2>

<p>The Web is a good place to begin learning about how technology works, and fundamental ICT concepts such as programming. It is ubiquitous and familiar, easy to learn compared to other programming platforms, and there is a lot of help available due to the web's largely free and open nature. This course will aim to teach children some background information on how the web works and why the web is so interesting, the basic fundamentals of HTML (the language used to structure data on the Web), CSS basics (the language used to style and layout the Web), possibly then moving on to some JavaScript (the web's main programming/logic language) if there is time.</p>

<p>There certainly isn't time in 10 hours to teach anything in any great depth, but here we will aim to give children what they need to produce a simple web page that can be presented via the school web site. Because the ability level of the children is likely to vary quite a bit, we will provide some advanced questions/exercises for any children that are finding the basic course level too easy and want to stretch themselves.</p>
